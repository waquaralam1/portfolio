# ðŸ”§ GitHub Pages Troubleshooting Guide

## "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here" - SOLUTION

This error means GitHub Pages isn't configured yet. Here's the step-by-step fix:

### Step 1: Check if Files are Uploaded
1. Go to https://github.com/waquaralam1/portfolio
2. You should see files like:
   - `index.html`
   - `package.json`
   - `src/` folder
   - `public/` folder
   - etc.

**If NO files are visible**: You need to upload them first!

### Step 2: Upload Files (If Not Done Yet)
1. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
2. Drag ALL files from your portfolio folder EXCEPT `node_modules`
3. Commit with message: "Add portfolio files"

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Go to your repo**: https://github.com/waquaralam1/portfolio
2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu bar of your repo)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"**:
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 4: Wait and Check
- Wait 2-10 minutes for GitHub to build your site
- GitHub will show a green checkmark when ready
- Your site will be at: https://waquaralam1.github.io/portfolio/

## Alternative Method: Use Actions Tab

If the above doesn't work:

1. Go to "Actions" tab in your repo
2. Check if there are any failed builds
3. If you see errors, the workflow file might need adjustment

## Quick Checklist âœ…

- [ ] Repository exists: https://github.com/waquaralam1/portfolio
- [ ] Files are uploaded (you can see index.html, src/, etc.)
- [ ] Settings â†’ Pages is configured
- [ ] Waited 5-10 minutes after setup
- [ ] No errors in Actions tab

## Still Not Working?

Try this simpler approach:

### Method 2: Direct HTML Upload
1. Create a simple `index.html` in your repo first
2. Enable Pages
3. Wait for it to work
4. Then upload the full portfolio
